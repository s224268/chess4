To play this game, we reccomend doing the following:
1. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ or Android Studio
2. Sync files with Gradle if necessary
3. Locate the Main-kt file
4. Run the main function

The program can be run from a terminal by:
1. navigating to the directory of chess4.main.jar (...out/artifacts/chess4_main_jar/chess4.main.jar)
2. Using the command java -jar chess4.main.jar

However, this is not recommended because many terminals do not allow for the display of unicode characters,
which are used to display pieces.
